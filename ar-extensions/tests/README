RUNNING THE TESTS
-----------------
To run the tests you can run rake tasks from the top level directory.
For more information on what tasks can be run, run "rake -T" from
the command line.

Currently the two available tasks are:
 - test:mysql
 - test:activerecord:mysql

Task - test:mysql
-----------------
The test:mysql tasks runs the ActiveRecord::Extensions tests for
MySQL. Before you can run these you must create a database and load
it's schema using the ../config/mysql.schema file. 

Task - test:activerecord:mysql
------------------------------
The test:activerecord:mysql takes one argument, the path to activerecord.
For activerecord testing purposes this must be the activerecord 
directory inside of a full rails download. 
  Example: "rake test:activerecord:mysql /home/zdennis/rails-1.1.6/activerecord"
This runs the ActiveRecord tasks with the ActiveRecord::Extensions loaded.

Database Configuration Updates 
------------------------------
ActiveRecord::Extension testing is moving in the direction of mimicking
ActiveRecord testing. The default testing configuration is housed in the
connection.rb file which is in the connections/native_xxxxx directory.
