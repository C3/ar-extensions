RUNNING THE TESTS
-----------------
To run the tests you can run rake tasks from the top level directory.
For more information on what tasks can be run, run "rake -T" from
the command line.

Currently the four available tasks are:
 - test:mysql
 - test:postgresql
 - test:activerecord:mysql
 - test:activerecord:postgresql

Task - test:<db_adapter>
-----------------
The test:<db_adapter> tasks runs the ActiveRecord::Extensions tests for
name of the <db_adapter>. Before you can run these you must create a database and load
it's schema using the ../config/<db_adapter>.schema file. 

Task - test:activerecord:<db_adapter> 
------------------------------
The test:activerecord:<db_adapter> takes one argument, the path to
activerecord.  For activerecord testing purposes this must be the
activerecord directory inside of a full rails download.

Example:   "rake test:activerecord:mysql /home/zdennis/rails-1.1.6/activerecord"

This runs the ActiveRecord tasks with the ActiveRecord::Extensions loaded.

Database Configuration Updates 
------------------------------
ActiveRecord::Extension testing is moving in the direction of mimicking
ActiveRecord testing. The default testing configuration is housed in the
connection.rb file which is in the connections/native_xxxxx directory.

TODOs For Testing
-----------------
 - Convert schema files to migrations
